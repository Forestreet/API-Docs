Before diving into our API's endpoints, ensure you're properly authenticated to access the desired data. Authentication is achieved through the x-api-key header, ensuring the security and integrity of the interactions.

### Header Example:

```bash
'x-api-key': '<api_token>'
```

## API Tokens

API tokens are the backbone of our authentication process, linking each request to a recognized and authorized user or application. These tokens should be kept confidential. If compromised, it's crucial to revoke and generate a new token immediately. To do this, reach out to us at info@forestreet.com.

Each token is associated with specific permissions, granting access to various levels and types of data. Speak to us about the various levels of data access that you require.
